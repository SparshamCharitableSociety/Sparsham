had a flag hosting ceremony. After that we distributed sweets to the kids and teachers over there. The next programme was to
spend some time by interacting with them. We were so happy to meet some extra ordinary talented kids, able to overcome their
challenges and stay stronger. It was a nice experience to us and great time for them. We had our lunch together and 
left the campus afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
